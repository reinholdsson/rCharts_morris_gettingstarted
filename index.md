## Getting started
<br/>
_ _ _
**This is a near exact replica of the [morris.js getting started tutorial](http://www.oesmith.co.uk/morris.js/index.html).  All credit and attribution should be directed there.  See the copyright and license at the end of this page.**

The original tutorial says, "Add morris.js and its dependencies ([jQuery](http://jquery.com/) & [Raphael](http://raphaeljs.com/)) to your page."   Fortunately for us, rCharts handles this for us, and slidify can access this rCharts' brilliance through the `ext_widgets: {rCharts: "libraries/morris"}` line in the header of this markdown.  The config.yml in the morris directory performs the magic.

<br/>
## Your first chart
Instead of the `<div>` and `<script>` in the original tutorial, we will build this chart all with the R code below.  You should notice a lot of similarity.


```r
#if you have not installed slidify, slidifyLibraries, or rCharts
#require(devtools)
#install_github('slidify', 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev')
#install_github('rCharts', 'ramnathv')
#install_github('slidifyLibraries', 'ramnathv', ref = 'dev') # optional

require(rCharts)
#specify the data
data = data.frame(
  c('2008', '2009', '2010', '2011', '2012'),
  c(20,10,5,5,20),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
colnames(data) <- c("year","value")
#build the plot
m1 <- mPlot(
  x = "year",
  y = "value",
  data = data,
  type = "Line"  
)
m1$set( labels = "value" ) 
m1
```


<div id='line-chart' class='rChart morris'></div>
<script type='text/javascript'>
    var chartParams = {
 "element": "line-chart",
"width":            800,
"height":            400,
"xkey": "year",
"ykeys": [
 "value" 
],
"data": [
 {
 "year": "2008",
"value":             20 
},
{
 "year": "2009",
"value":             10 
},
{
 "year": "2010",
"value":              5 
},
{
 "year": "2011",
"value":              5 
},
{
 "year": "2012",
"value":             20 
} 
],
"labels": "value",
"id": "line-chart" 
},
      chartType = "Line"
    new Morris[chartType](chartParams)
</script>
